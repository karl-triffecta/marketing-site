</p> <h2>3. About cookies</h2> <p>
3.1 A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters
          and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is
          stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server
          each time the browser requests a page from the server.
</p> <p>
3.2 Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a
          persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain
          valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the
          expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the
          end of the user session when the web browser is closed.
