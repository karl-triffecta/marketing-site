<p>
  Retail media is having a momentâ€”and itâ€™s more than just a trend. As third-party cookies fade and advertisers look for new ways to reach consumers, retail media is stepping into the spotlight.
</p>

<p><strong>But what exactly is retail media?</strong></p>

<p>
  At its core, retail media refers to advertising within a retailerâ€™s owned platformsâ€”think sponsored products, on-site display ads, in-store ads, and out of home campaigns using retailersâ€™ inventory and first-party data. Itâ€™s like putting your ad right at the point of sale.
</p>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>

<p>
  Retailers now sit on a goldmine of customer dataâ€”purchase history, browsing behavior, loyalty program insightsâ€”and are increasingly monetising it. For brands, this is a chance to target shoppers in the moment theyâ€™re ready to buy.
</p>

<p>
  That precision drives results: better ROI, improved attribution, and a stronger link between media spend and sales.
</p>

<h2>Retail Media in the UK: Who are the Players</h2>

<p>In the UK, the retail media landscape is rapidly evolving. Some notable players include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Tesco Media & Insight</strong> (powered by dunnhumby) â€“ a data-rich offering combining in-store and online inventory
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sainsburyâ€™s Nectar360</strong> â€“ tapping into loyalty data to create targeted campaigns
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>ASDA Media Group</strong> and <strong>Boots Media Group</strong> â€“ newer but increasingly sophisticated entrants
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Iceland Foods</strong> have literally just announced their investment into Retail Media
  </li>
  <li>
    While <strong>Amazon</strong> remains a dominant force in UK retail media, itâ€™s a media platform first, retailer second
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>How Is It Managed?</h2>

<p>Thereâ€™s no one-size-fits-all model, but typically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In-house retail media teams or external partners (e.g. CitrusAd, Criteo) manage campaigns</li>
  <li>Self-serve platforms are growing, giving brands direct access to plan, book, and report on campaigns</li>
  <li>Retailers are becoming media owners, with agencies adapting to work more like media buyers</li>
</ul>

<p>
  But hereâ€™s the challenge: retail media is fragmented. Brands often deal with multiple platforms, inconsistent measurement, and a mix of walled gardens. Thatâ€™s where strategy and integration come in.
</p>

<h2>Whatâ€™s Next?</h2>

<p>As retail media matures in the UK, expect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Standardization of metrics (ROAS, incrementality, attention)</li>
  <li>More off-site activations, using retail data to power social/display</li>
  <li>Closer alignment with trade marketing and ecommerce teams</li>
  <li>New players from non-grocery verticals (fashion, beauty, DIY)</li>
</ul>
