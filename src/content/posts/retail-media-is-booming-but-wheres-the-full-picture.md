  <p>
    Retail media is now a core part of the marketing mix. And it’s working—search drives conversion, retailers offer rich first-party data, and campaigns are running across more platforms than ever.
  </p>

  <p><strong>But here's the catch</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>You're logging into <strong>5+ different systems</strong> just to understand what’s performing</li>
    <li>You're relying on <strong>inconsistent metrics</strong> that make comparisons near impossible</li>
    <li>You're burning <strong>time and resource</strong> trying to build a picture that’s still incomplete</li>
    <li>…And Management wants a report by the end of day on what is driving sales</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Sound familiar?</p>

  <p>
    <strong>
      You know <i>search</i> works. But <i>which</i> search term? <i>Where? At what cost per sale?</i>
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    The reality is: without a <strong>joined-up view</strong>, even the best-performing campaigns can get lost in the noise.
  </p>

  <h2>That’s Where Triffecta Comes In</h2>

  <p>
    Triffecta integrates directly with retail media platforms like Criteo, CitrusAd, and retailer-owned media networks—<strong>pulling everything into a single, clear view.</strong>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>No more spreadsheets</li>
    <li>No more channel-by-channel guesswork</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Just <strong>one platform (one log in, yes you heard that correctly)</strong> that shows you:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>What’s driving performance across retailers</li>
    <li>Which campaigns are delivering real ROI</li>
    <li>Where to optimise in real time</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Smarter Decisions. Less Noise. More Growth.</h2>

  <p>
    Retail media shouldn't mean more dashboards and more headcount.
    It should mean <strong>more clarity.</strong> More speed. More value.
  </p>
