        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>1.1 Our website uses cookies.</p>
        <p>
          1.2 Insofar as those cookies are not strictly necessary for the
          provision of [our website and services], we will ask you to consent to
          our use of cookies when you first visit our website.

          2.1 This document was created using a template from Docular (<a

        <h2>3. About cookies</h2>
        <p>
          3.1 A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters
          and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is
          stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server
          each time the browser requests a page from the server.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.2 Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a
          persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain
          valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the
          expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the
          end of the user session when the web browser is closed.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.3 Cookies may not contain any information that personally identifies
          a user, but personal data that we store about you may be linked to the
          information stored in and obtained from cookies.
        </p>
